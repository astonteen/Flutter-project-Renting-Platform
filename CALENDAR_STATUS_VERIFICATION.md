# 🎯 Calendar Status Indicators Verification Guide

## ✅ **What Was Fixed**
- Enhanced status indicators were added to the **correct calendar screen** (`RefactoredLenderCalendarScreen`)
- The app router uses `RefactoredLenderCalendarScreen`, not `EnhancedLenderCalendarScreen`
- Status indicators now show preparation/ready status for confirmed bookings

## 🧪 **Quick Test Steps**

### **1. Open Lender Calendar**
```
App → Calendar Tab (bottom navigation)
```

### **2. Look for Enhanced Status Indicators**
For **confirmed bookings**, you should now see **TWO status badges**:

```
┌─────────────┬─────────────┐
│ CONFIRMED   │ AVAILABLE   │ ← Main status + Ready status
└─────────────┴─────────────┘
```

### **3. Expected Status Combinations**

#### **🟢 Green "AVAILABLE"**
- Item is prepared AND pickup time has arrived
- Booking date has started

#### **🟠 Orange "PREPARED"**
- Item is marked ready but pickup date hasn't arrived yet
- Lender prepared early (within 2-3 day window)

#### **🔵 Blue "CAN PREP"**
- Within preparation window (2-3 days before pickup)
- Item not yet marked ready

#### **⚪ Grey "TOO EARLY"**
- Outside preparation window
- Too early to mark item ready

## 🚨 **If You Don't See Status Indicators**

### **Check 1: Booking Status**
- Status indicators only appear for **CONFIRMED** bookings
- Pending/cancelled bookings won't show ready status

### **Check 2: BookingModel Data**
- Verify `isItemReady` field exists in booking data
- Check if `isDeliveryRequired` field is present

### **Check 3: App Restart**
- Hot reload might not update all widgets
- Try full app restart: `flutter run`

## 📝 **Test Scenario**

1. **Create a confirmed booking** starting tomorrow
2. **Check calendar** - should show "CAN PREP" (blue)
3. **Mark item as ready** from lender home screen
4. **Return to calendar** - should show "PREPARED" (orange)
5. **Wait until pickup date** - should show "AVAILABLE" (green)

## ✅ **Success Criteria**

- [ ] Two status badges visible for confirmed bookings
- [ ] Colors match expected states (green/orange/blue/grey)
- [ ] Text matches expected labels (AVAILABLE/PREPARED/CAN PREP/TOO EARLY)
- [ ] Status updates when item marked ready
- [ ] Status reflects pickup timing correctly

## 🎉 **Expected Result**

The calendar should now provide **clear visual feedback** about:
- ✅ When items can be prepared
- ✅ When items are prepared but not yet available  
- ✅ When items are ready for immediate pickup
- ✅ When it's too early to prepare items

**This enhances the lender workflow by providing preparation guidance directly in the calendar view!**
